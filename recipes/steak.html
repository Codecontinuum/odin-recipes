        <h2>Recipe Overview</h2>
        <p>
            This Cuban-inspired mojo marinade would work great as an all-purpose marinade for 
            just about anything destined for the grill, but skirt steak is my top choice.
        </p>

        <h2>Ingredients</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>2 pounds beef skirt steak</li>
            <li>1 large navel orange, juiced</li>
            <li>3 limes, juiced</li>
            <li>¼ cup olive oil, plus more for drizzling</li>
            <li>6 cloves garlic, finely minced</li>
            <li>1 tablespoon kosher salt</li>
            <li>1½ teaspoons ground cumin</li>
            <li>1 teaspoon freshly ground black pepper</li>
            <li>½ teaspoon dried oregano</li>
            <li>½ teaspoon cayenne pepper</li>
            <li>½ onion, thinly sliced</li>
            <li>½ cup fresh chopped cilantro</li>
            <li>1 teaspoon coarse salt for finishing</li>
            <li>Lime wedges for serving</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>Directions</h2>
        <ol>
            <li>
                <p>
                    Cut skirt steaks into about 3 or 4 smaller pieces so it's 
                    easier to fit them into marinade dish.
                </p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <p>
                    Whisk orange juice, lime juice, olive oil, garlic, salt, cumin, pepper, oregano, 
                    and cayenne pepper together in a large bowl. Place skirt steak pieces, 1 at a time, 
                    into the marinade to thoroughly coat them. Add sliced onions and toss with the meat.
                </p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <p>
                    Transfer mixture and marinade to a resealable plastic bag. Squeeze out air, seal bag, 
                    and place on a dish. Refrigerate 2 to 3 hours.
                </p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <p>
                    Transfer pieces of meat onto paper towel-lined rimmed sheet pan to drain for a 
                    couple of minutes.
                </p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <p>
                    Cook over hot coals. Grill first side 3 to 4 minutes. Turn and grill second side until 
                    internal temperature is about 125 degrees F (53 degrees C). Look for a shiny glossy surface 
                    indicating the meat juice is coming to the surface; this indicates the meat is just about done. 
                    Transfer to a plate and allow meat to rest a few minutes.
                </p>

                <p>
                    Slice into 1/2-inch slices and arrange on a serving plate. Spoon accumulated juices over the meat. 
                    Drizzle with olive oil and sprinkle with coarse salt and chopped cilantro. Serve with lime wedges.
