        <h2>Recipe Overview</h2>
        <p>
            This ice cream sandwich cake was renamed as "The Best Dessert I've Ever Eaten" by my 
            daughter this Memorial Day. I had made it before, but my husband ate all of it before 
            she had a chance to get a taste! My husband doesn't like when I take this desert to a 
            large gathering because it means he won't have any leftovers!
        </p>

                    Repeat layering with remaining ice cream sandwiches, whipped topping, hot
